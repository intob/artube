      <h2>Meet Arweave:<br>Permanent information storage.</h2>
      <p>The Arweave network is like Bitcoin, but for data: A permanent and decentralized web inside an open ledger.</p>
      <p>Permanent storage has many applications: from the preservation of humanity's most important data, to the hosting of truly decentralized and provably neutral web apps.</p>
      <p>The Arweave protocol is stable, mature and widely adopted. As such, its ecosystem is fully decentralized.</p>

      <h2>So what is ArTube?</h2>
      <p>Using this webapp, anyone can upload videos & associated content onto the Arweave network.</p>
      <p>Your personal channel is secured by your wallet.</p>
      <p>The result of an upload is a permanently stored video file, an associated metadata file, and a poster image.</p>
      <p>Noone can change the data, remove it, or censor it. You can access it using any webapp or any gateway.</p>
